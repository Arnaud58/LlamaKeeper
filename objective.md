You are a Python project orchestrator. I want you to design and generate all the files needed to create a complete application that functions as a local clone of AI Dungeon with autonomous AI characters.

### Objective:
Create a web application (frontend + backend) in Python that allows the user to experience an interactive narrative adventure, where the AI generates the text of the story. The application must also allow for the management of multiple main characters, each with a memory, personality, and the ability to respond individually through separate calls to a local AI (via Ollama).

### General constraints:
- The **frontend** will be in HTML/CSS/JS (can use HTMX or pure JS).
- The **backend** will be in Python (FastAPI recommended).
- Everything must run **locally** (no cloud, no external calls).
- The AI used is Ollama, via its local API (http://localhost:11434/api/generate).

### Main features to be implemented:

#### 1. Interactive narration
- Allow the user to type actions/phrases.
- Display the text generated by the AI in a readable interface.
- Maintain the session history.

#### 2. Autonomous characters
- Each main character must have:
- A name, a personality (traits + background)
- A persistent memory (significant events experienced)
    - Objectives (personal goals)
- Responses to a situation must be generated individually for each character via a **separate call to Ollama**, with its own context.

#### 3. Memory and continuity
- Memorisation of each important interaction (events, dialogues).
- Storage in JSON or simple database format (e.g. SQLite).
- Automatic injection of memory and traits into prompts.

#### 4. AI generation system
- Implement a `generate_response(prompt, model="mistral")` function that calls the Ollama API.
- Adapt the prompt to each character by combining:
- their personality
- their condensed memory
- the current situation
- Support parameters such as `temperature`, `top_p`, etc.

#### 5. User interface (Web UI)
- Display of the narrative scene.
- User input form.
- Display of responses from different characters.
- Option to display a character's ‘memory log’.

#### 6. Session management
- Ability to save/reload a complete session (story + character states).
- Automatic loading on opening.

### Expected deliverables:
- All necessary Python files
- HTML templates for the frontend
- A README explaining how to run the project
- An example JSON character with personality, memory, and goals

Divide this project intelligently into subtasks and start generating the modules one by one. Start by defining the data models (`Character`, `Memory`, `StoryContext`) and the `generate_response` API. Then build the backend interface, followed by the frontend.


### First Task 

Design the system architecture and data models for a local AI Dungeon clone with autonomous AI characters. The design should include:

1. System Architecture:
- Define the overall architecture (FastAPI backend + HTML/JS frontend)
- Specify key components and their interactions
- Design the communication flow between frontend, backend, and Ollama API

2. Data Models:
- Character model (name, personality traits, background, objectives)
- Memory model (storing character experiences and events)
- Story/Session model (current state, history)
- Define JSON schemas for all models

3. API Design:
- List all required endpoints
- Specify request/response formats
- Define the story generation flow

4. Database Schema:
- Design SQLite tables for persistent storage
- Define relationships between entities

5. Project Structure:
- Outline the directory structure
- List all required files and their purposes

Constraints:
- Must run completely locally
- Uses Ollama API (http://localhost:11434/api/generate) for AI generation
- Frontend uses HTML/CSS/JS (can use HTMX)
- Backend uses FastAPI
- SQLite for persistence

Please provide comprehensive documentation of the architecture and design decisions. Use the attempt_completion tool when finished, including all schemas and specifications in the result.
